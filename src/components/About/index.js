      <p>
        My name is Amy Gardiner and I am currently taking the Washington
        University Coding Boot Camp to become a web developer. I've created this
        portfolio, not only as a class challenge assignment, but also as a way
        to practice my skills and highlight my most recent projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        I graduated Magna Cum Laude from Southern Illinois University
        Edwardsville in May 2013, and majored in speech communication, on the
        public relations track. I also studied theater history literature and
        criticism and business marketing, and received a minor in both.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, since graduation, I have worked in the marketing field
        with Missouri Botanical Garden, AmeriCorps VISTA, City of Memphis'
        Office of Youth Services, and H&R Block. I've also developed my customer
        service and management skills working at Leon Uniform Company and
        Kaldi's Coffee.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I finish the WashU Boot Camp, I'm excited to step into a new career
        field and continue to grow as a full-stack web developer.
