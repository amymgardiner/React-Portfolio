      <p>
        My name is Amy Gardiner and I recently completed the Washington
        University Coding Boot Camp to become a web developer. I've created this
        portfolio, not only as a class challenge assignment, but also as a way
        to practice my skills and highlight my most recent projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bootcamp taught me a lot of practical and technical skills in
        JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, GitHub, REST APIs, jQuery, Node.js,
        Express.js, MySQL, MongoDB, Graphql, Insomnia, Apollo, Handlebars.js,
        Heroku, and React.js. It also taught me how to follow the Agile
        methodology and work together in a development team through our group
        projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the bootcamp, I also graduated Magna Cum Laude from
        Southern Illinois University Edwardsville in May 2013, and majored in
        speech communication, on the public relations track. I also studied
        theater history, literature, and criticism in addition to business
        marketing, and received a minor in both.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, since graduation, I have worked in the marketing field
        with Missouri Botanical Garden, AmeriCorps VISTA, City of Memphis'
        Office of Youth Services, and H&R Block. I've also developed my customer
        service and management skills working at Leon Uniform Company and
        Kaldi's Coffee.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that I've finished the WashU Boot Camp, I'm excited to step into a
        new career field and continue to grow as a full-stack web developer.
